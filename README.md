# Phototactic-Robot-using-Light-sensors-to-Navigate
A phototactic robot designed using Arduino, L293D motor driver, and LDRs to navigate towards the brightest light source. This project includes code for motor control and light detection, with detailed schematics and simulation tested on Tinkercad. Explore the project to see how light sensors guide robotic movement!
